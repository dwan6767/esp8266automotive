This project uses the **ESP8266** (ESP-01 / NodeMCU) for automotive applications.  
It contains firmware, documentation, and supporting files for experimenting with ESP8266 in vehicles.

##  Repository Structure
- **firmware/** → ESP8266 source code (Arduino/ESP-IDF/Non-OS SDK).  
- **parts/** → Hardware schematics, wiring, and component details.  
- **documentation/** → Notes, guides, and references.  
- **sign/** → Logs, revisions, and versioning notes.  

##  Features
- WiFi-based communication using ESP8266  
- Automotive signal monitoring  
- Modular firmware design  
- Expandable for IoT integration  

##  Requirements
- ESP8266 (ESP-01, NodeMCU, or similar)  
- Arduino IDE / PlatformIO  
- Automotive power adapter (12V → 3.3V regulator)  

##  Getting Started
1. Clone the repo:
